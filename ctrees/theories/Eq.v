Equivalence of computations
===========================
This file reexports everything that's necessary to reason w.r.t.
[equ] (coinductive structural equality) and [sbisim] (strong bisimulation).
Tactics are redefined locally to support both relations.

(*|
The upto [bind] context principle for [equ] and [sbisim] ---
the same tactic covers both cases, whether in front of a [gfp], [t _] or [bt _].
The three variants are:
- [upto_bind]: leave you with both proof obligations, introducing an evar for the intermediate relation in the case of [equ]
- [upto_bind_eq]: meant to be use when the prefixes of the computations
are identical: assumes [reflexivity] will solve the first goal, and proceed to substitute the equality
- [upto_bind with SS]: for [equ], provides explicitly the intermediate relation
